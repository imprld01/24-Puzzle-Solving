# 24-Puzzle-Solving

A program to find solution of a given 24-puzzle problem.  
Given a intial state of a 24-puzzle problem,  
and the program finds the best solution, the one with the fewest steps,  
by A* searching according to Manhattan Distance, a consistent heuristic. 

This is an assignment on NTOU Artificial Intelligence 2016 Spring.  
This repository as a note for me help me to find the code in the future! ðŸ˜€
